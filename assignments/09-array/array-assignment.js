/* Question 1 
 Question 1
Given an array of product objects in a user cart, write a function that takes in an array of
product objects, and returns the sum of the prices multiplied by the quantity of all the items

>> object signature is
>>    const userCart = { itemName: string; price: number, quntity: number }[]



## Question 2
Given an array of numbers with some numbers repeated, write a function that takes in
an array of numbers, and returns a object in the signature below, showing each number, 
and how many times occours in the array

input (array) -> output (object)

>> object signature sample
>>    input -> [3, 5, 6, 7, 3, 4, 8, 3, 4]
>>    output ->  { number: 3, occourence: 5, number: 2, occourence: 7, number: 7, occourence: 1 }


## Question 3
Write a function that checks if a word is exactly the same when spelt forward and backwards

sample: rever === rever -> true

/*
Question 1

At lifecycle 1: The function receives an array of product objects (userCart).

At lifecycle 2: The reduce() method initializes the accumulator (total) to 0.

At lifecycle 3: The function iterates through each product object in the array.

At lifecycle 4: For each product, it calculates the item's total cost by multiplying price by quantity.

At lifecycle 5: The calculated item cost is added to the running total.

At lifecycle 6: After all items have been processed, the function returns the final total cost of the cart.

Question 3
At lifecycle 1: The function receives the word "never".
